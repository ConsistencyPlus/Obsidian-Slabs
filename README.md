# Obsidian Slab

Literally just adds the Obsidian slab from Consistency+ as a separate block.

IMS (Yes, Iris Shaders IMS), a member of the C+ team at the time was the guy in charge of alot of the actual code when making the inital block, Siuol took care of the separation after the fact and maintains this specific mod.
